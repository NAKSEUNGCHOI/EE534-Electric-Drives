# ECE 534 Electric Drives

UW ECE 534 Electric Drives Project

## Description

* A boost converter boosts a 24V input voltage to 48V. 
* An inverter receives this filtered 48V from the boost converter to generate three sinusoidal voltage waveforms.
* The output currents feed a BLDC motor.
* With C2000 piccolo launchpad 4 PI controllers are implemented to control the entire system:
* Current control and voltage control for the boost converter and current and speed control for the BLDC motor.
